### Summary
This sample is written in Kotlin and uses the following Components:
-  ViewModel
-  LiveData
-  DataBinding
-  Navigation
-  Room
-  Retrofit
-  Dagger2
-  Junit
-  Mockk
-  Truth
-  Mockwebserver
 
There's no RXJava because thanks to Kotlin Flow and Coroutine support for retrofit we don't need it in Kotlin anymore!

It uses [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)'s REST API
