# Jikanium

This sample is written in Kotlin and uses the following Components:

 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room
 - Retrofit
 - Dagger2
 
 - Junit4
 - Mockk
 - truth
 - mockwebserver
 
There's no RXJava because thanks to Kotlin Flow and Coroutine support for retrofit we don't need it in Kotlin anymore!
